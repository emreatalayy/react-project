      longDescription: "This project (D-A-T BOT) aimed to instill empathy in chatbots by performing emotion analysis from images using our custom-developed CNN architecture and from text using LSTM architecture. Additionally, methods such as RAG and Prompt Engineering were applied to the chatbot to prevent common hallucinations in LLMs and to avoid answering off-topic questions. We won 1st place in the GLOBAL-CENG graduation projects competition, held for the first time in collaboration with Turkcell Global Bilgi and KTÜ, and secured 3rd place in the 2024 CENG DEMO DAY competition."
